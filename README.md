# Practical-Computer-Vision
In this repo, I will use more practical codes that can be used in the computer vision field.

Please check my other repos if you want to see more advanced stuff such as CNNs being used for computer vision applications, Thank You.

My recommendation: [Tuning CNNs to detect sick patients from x-ray Images](https://github.com/AmirHHasani/Manual-tuning-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-a-medical-image-dataset-x-ray-images-)
